# overview

hey! thanks for thinking about contributing to yttria!
all contributions are welcome, whether itâ€™s code, docs, tests, or ideas.

## how to contribute

- fork the repo and create a new branch for your changes
- make your changes (keep code clean & readable)
- run tests and make sure everything passes
- open a pull request with a clear but small description of your changes
- be respectful and constructive in discussions

## setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/grngxd/yttria
cd yttria

# install bun (https://bun.sh)
bun i

# install llvm (14.0.x) e.g. 14.0.6
bun run --watch .
```

## style guide

- PascalCase for constants & types, camelCase for variables & functions
- use tabs for indentation (4 spaces) (not a requirement, we can uses biome or something)
- keep code concise, and easy to read (noticing a theme?)
- prefer type inference where possible (in both yt and ts)
- write meaningful commit messages (im soooo guilty of not doing this before v0.0.1)

## issues & suggestions

- open an issue for bugs, feature requests, or questions
- include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, code samples, etc.)
- check for existing issues before opening a new one
- please dont be mad if your issue is closed, it may be a duplicate or not relevant anymore

## roadmap

see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and [TODO.md](TODO.md) for current progress and priorities, try to make your own judgement on current progress though, as these are slightly outdated most of the time, some features may be cut at any time too.
