## key goals
**high performance**: designed for speed, with performance rivaling rust & C

**expressiveness**: write concise, clean & clear code for everything from web development to systems programming
**safety & ergonomics**: statically-typed with encouraged type inference & robust err handling

**write once, run anywhere**: build reliable software for any platform (or none at all) with a friendly std library
